    <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Definition:</b> 
        Encapsulation involves bundling the data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> 
        Here, speed is encapsulated within the Car class and is not directly accessible from outside the class, but it can be modified and accessed through the methods accelerate() and getSpeed().
